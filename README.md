GitHub repo:
https://github.com/sabrtraveler/puppy-pals 

##Elevator Pitch
People have all sorts of apps to meet each other but what about our dogs? Puppy Pals is a social network events platform for dog lovers, where your dog can meet other dogs to have a  playdate. Members can create profiles for themselves and their pets. They can use the dashboard to see pet-friendly events in their area.

##Motivation for development:
Being dog owners we wanted to create an app to connect with other dogs and owners at dog friendly events.

##User story:
As a dog owner, I want to be able to connect with other owners, so that I can meet new people and dogs at a meetup spot.

##Challenges:
Heroku trying to connect to actual URLs instead of one page application
Connecting Atlas to Heroku
Managing mutations/queries and typos

##Directions for Future Development
Enhance user experience by providing an option to add photos of Dogs, Owners, and Event locations
Add a comment and message feature to be used for Event posts and to message between users
Add a reaction feature to users posts
Social media sharing feature for events
